## üî≠ About

---

In this project, I study whether response times in negotiations reveal the responder's evaluation of the offer, and thus can be used strategically by the proposers. I use an eBay dataset containing millions of bargaining exchanges between June 2012 - June 2013 to answer this question.

## üîç Research question

---

When negotiating, does the time it takes somebody to get back to you with tell you something about how good they think your offer was?

Consider this situation. Imagine you go on eBay to buy something (e.g. art poster for your room). You come across this listing. You can click ‚ÄòBuy it Now‚Äô to buy the listing at $22 or click ‚ÄòMake an offer‚Äô to send a private offer to the seller of $15 for instance.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="800"%}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>


Now, the seller rejects you so you go and make the $15 offer to another seller with the same good and price. This seller also rejects you. The only difference between the sellers is that the first one rejected you quickly ( üêá¬†), while the second one took longer ( üê¢¬†) to reject you. 

Which seller should you choose to continue to negotiate with? The one who rejected **quickly** ( üêá¬†) or the one who rejected **slowly** ( üê¢¬†)?

If I were you, I would choose the **slow seller** and I‚Äôm going to show you why.

## üëæ Methods

---

**Dataset:** eBay recently released a dataset with all exchanges for listings created from June 2012 to June 2013 ([Backus et al. 2020](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/3/1319/5721265)). The dataset consists of millions of bargaining exchanges.

**Variables:** Each bargaining exchange contains:

- identification variables for seller, buyer and item
- seller experience variables such as number of previous bargaining exchanges they have participated in or number of listings created
- item characteristics variables such as list price, category name, number of views, listing age
- offer characteristics variables such as
    - offer price,
    - response to the offer (acceptance, rejection, counteroffer, expired, automatically accepted, automatically rejected, rejected because another buyer‚Äôs offer was accepted)
    - response time (time between when the offer was made and when the seller responded).

**Data partition:** In order to preserve some of the data for later replication analyses, the dataset was randomly partitioned into five parts, each with approximately 20% of the dataset. The partition was done randomly at the seller level to ensure that all exchanges including a specific seller were in only one part. For the analyses in this project, I only use one randomly selected part (i.e. 20%) of the data.                

**Data cleaning:** I wanted to make sure I exclude any errors in the dataset and also restrict the analyses to the relevant cases. 

I cleaned the data by first excluding exchanges with errors such as (1) If the item is sold, the sale price is above the listing price (0.2% excluded); (2) An offer is above the list price (1.8% excluded) and so on.

I also exclude other cases that might interfere with the question of interest such as (1) The seller has an accept or reject price threshold set (36% excluded); (2) No competing offers arriving at the same time the seller is considering another offer (8.6% excluded); (3) No messages included with the offer (9.8% excluded).

The final dataset of first buyer‚Äôs offers after applying all the restrictions consisted of 1,128,999 bargaining exchanges spread across 1,043,320 listings with 74,443 sellers and 743,343 buyers. 

**Analysis 1** (modeling non-monotonicity in the data using **Generalized Additive Models**): Because I noticed that the response time to offers wasn‚Äôt monotonic, I decided to use Generalized Additive Models to visualize and test for the effect of offer price as a percent of list price on the response time of the seller. These models incorporate smooth functions of the independent variables ([Wood et al. 2017](https://books.google.com/books/about/Generalized_Additive_Models.html?id=HL-PDwAAQBAJ)). These models are also useful to identify ranges in which the data is monotonic. The GAM regressions identify \[0.36, 0.68] as the range of offers for which both acceptance and rejection response times were monotonic. This was done based on when the first derivative of each GAM became significantly different from zero beyond their peaks (calculated using finite differences).

**Analysis 2** (modeling item category and seller level effects using **linear mixed effects regressions**): Using the restricted offer range in which the relationship between offer and response time was linear, I look at whether the effect is present for each item category and for each seller, not just in the aggregate. For this analyses, I use linear mixed effects regressions at the item category and seller level.

## üê≥ Main Results

**Results Analysis 1:** Sellers‚Äô RT‚Äôs varied significantly with offer size - over most of the offer range \[20%, 100%], the median acceptance RT decreased with offer size from 2 hours down to 0.8 hours, while over most of the offer range \[0, 70%], the median rejection RT increased with offer size, from 1.3 hours up to 1.8 hours (Fig. 1A). The relationship is evidence using a GAM regressions as well (Fig. 1B).

**Results Analysis 2:** These effects were largely consistent across product categories, ranging from baseball cards to vehicles, with 28/32 categories showing a positive relation between RT and offer size for acceptances and 26/32 categories showing the opposite relation for rejections (Fig. 2).

Seller-level regressions revealed a similar pattern, with 69% showing negative offer-RT correlations for acceptances but only 53% showing positive offer-RT correlations for rejections (Fig. 3).

## üê° Additional Results

**Additional Question 1:** Does this effect hold for buyers as well. More specifically, do buyers‚Äô RT‚Äôs also varied with the size of sellers‚Äô counteroffers?

**Result:** Sellers were not the only ones whose RT‚Äôs showed interesting variation ‚Äì buyers‚Äô RT‚Äôs also varied with the size of sellers‚Äô counteroffers (Fig. 4). Looking at the gap between a seller‚Äôs counteroffer and their buyer‚Äôs original offer, larger gaps led to faster rejections and slower acceptances from the buyers. The difference in RT was substantial, increasing from 2.96 hours to 5.58 hours for compromises from 10% to 100%.

Buyers‚Äô median RT (in hours) as a function of sellers‚Äô compromise, conditional on the buyer accepting or rejecting the offers. The seller‚Äôs compromise is the amount that they lowered their counteroffer, divided by the gap between the list price and the buyer‚Äôs offer. A 100% compromise would be a counteroffer that matches the buyer‚Äôs offer; a 0% compromise would be a counteroffer that is the list price. The size of the dots indicates the relative amount of data in that bin, across both curves, and the bars represent bootstrapped standard errors.

**Additional Question 2:** Does the relationship between offer and RT also hold for the second and third buyer offer? 

**Result:** Yes, it seems this effect is not limited to the first buyer offer. However, the effect for rejections is weaker overall and only marginally significant for the third buyer offer.

</div>


**Additional Question 3:** I excluded exchanges where the seller had a private threshold set. However, if the offer is in-between an accept or reject threshold then the seller still has to respond so these cases could be analyzed as well.

**Result:** First, I look at which sellers are more likely to set private thresholds. Then, I look at whether the same relationship between offer and RT of the seller holds in cases where the threshold was privately set but the offer was either above the reject threshold or below the accept thresholds. In these cases, I can use the threshold as a boundary for the seller‚Äôs true valuation of the item. 

The pre-existing data from eBay indicate that most sellers (62%) do not use automatic thresholds. In the subset of data that I analyzed, 17% used only rejection thresholds, 5.4% used only acceptance thresholds, and 15.7% used both thresholds. To examine the effect of seller experience on automatic threshold use, I looked at the number of best-offer listings created by each seller (dating back to 2008), The relation between seller experience and threshold usage was quadratic ‚Äì both inexperienced and highly experienced sellers used thresholds more than medium-experience sellers (Fig. 6A). While these results do not rule out that sellers have plans, the low rate of automatic thresholds suggests that sellers prefer to evaluate offers as they arrive. Moreover, for the exchanges with thresholds, a similar pattern between offer and RT holds (Fig. 6B).

Probability of using an accept or reject threshold, both thresholds or neither threshold, as a function of seller experience quantile. Seller experience represents the number of previous bargaining exchanges the seller has participated in. All bargaining exchanges were sorted by seller experience into ten equal sized bins. In other words, each observation was a single exchange. I did it this way, rather than sorting at the seller level, because a single seller might have some exchanges with thresholds and others without. B. Sellers‚Äô median RT (in hours) as a function of buyers‚Äô initial offers as a percent of list price, conditional on the seller accepting or rejecting the offers for bargaining exchanges with either rejection or acceptance threshold and offers that were between these thresholds.

The coefficients are from a linear regression of log(RT) on first buyer offer ratio (z-score) conditional on the seller accepting, or rejecting the offers using a restricted offer range (\[0.36, 0.68]) similar to the analyses of observations without thresholds. The regressions also includes random effects (clustered by seller) on the intercept and first buyer offer ratio.*

**Additional Question 4:** What about countered offers? Does a counteroffer on eBay resemble an acceptance or a rejection?

**Result:** Sellers‚Äô counteroffers also displayed a significant relation between log(RT) and offer size. We had speculated that counteroffers might look more like rejections but instead they looked more like acceptances. These RT monotonically decreased with offer size over the range \[10%, 100%] from 1.46 hours to 0.54 hours (Fig. 7).

## üß©¬†Puzzling Results

---

**Question:** Finally, there is the question of how buyers on eBay respond to sellers‚Äô RT‚Äôs. Since a fast rejection from a seller should signal to the buyer that their offer was not competitive, buyers who are rejected quickly should be discouraged from coming back with a second offer. Instead, I observed the opposite effects. Does this happen on eBay?

**Result:** Indeed, in a lab experiment from my lab, [Konovalov & Krajbich (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/uead055) found that second offers adjust more after a fast rejection than a slow rejection. However, in the existing eBay data, I observed the opposite effects. Buyers were more, not less, likely to make a second offer for faster rejections (Fig. 8A) and conditional on making a second offer, those offers were lower for faster rejections (Fig. 8B). Thus, counter to the lab data and to our predictions, buyers on eBay appear to be encouraged by a fast rejection.

</div>

In order to investigate whether there was selection bias when analyzing buyers‚Äô second offers, I first looked at the probability of the buyer making a second offer as a function of the first offer. Buyers were most likely to make a second offer if their first offer was around half of the list price. For other first offers there was a sharp decrease in the likelihood of making a second offer. To account for this selection bias, I used the Heckman correction ([Heckman, 1979](https://doi.org/10.2307/1912352)). 

The Heckman correction is a two-step statistical approach that corrects for non-randomly selected samples. In the first stage, I modeled the probability of the buyer making a second offer conditional on the first offer being rejected. This model helps identify the factors that influence whether the buyer makes a second offer or the selection process and calculates the inverse Mills ratio. The inverse Mills ratio is a measure of the probability of an observation being included in the sample, given its characteristics and the estimated parameters from the selection equation. It provides a way to quantify the selection bias that arises when the sample is not randomly selected from the population. In the second stage, I correct for self-selection by incorporating the inverse Mills ratio as an additional explanatory variable. This adjusted regression accounts for the selection bias by incorporating the correction factor from the selection equation. I estimated this model using the R package sampleSelection. The results do not change when accounting for this sampling bias.

## üèÅ¬†Conclusions

---

These results show, using data from eBay's bargaining exchanges, that a significant proportion of responders do not adhere to preset strategies but decide in real-time in a way that reveals private information. The time agents take to respond becomes an inadvertent indicator of their evaluation of an offer. These findings show that RT can unintentionally expose an person's private preferences, offering a potential strategic advantage to the proposers.
