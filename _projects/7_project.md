title: Altruism and attention to social information
description: Our decisions are often influenced by what those around us do. However, not everybody conforms. It is unclear whether people don‚Äôt conform because they are not aware of social norms, or because they disregard them.

## üî≠ About

---

Our decisions are often influenced by what those around us do, but we are also inclined to seek out similar others. Research on social influence has focused more on choice behavior and less on process data such as eye-movement patterns produced during the deliberation process. However, process data can reveal hidden information about a person‚Äôs preferences in situations where choices alone might not be informative.

Using eye-tracking in the lab, we study the effect of social influence on altruism. We record participants‚Äô eye movements while inspecting others‚Äô previous choices before making their own giving decisions. We correlate the types of behavioral responses to social information with specific attention pattern and to test whether attention patterns alone can be used to infer giving behavior.

Not everybody conforms. Why? Attention? Are non-conformists unaware of what others are doing?

## üëæ Methods

**Task**

Subjects decided how many out of 100 tokens to give to an anonymous recipient. Subjects were paid based on how many tokens they decided to keep while the anonymous recipient received the shared tokens multiplied by an exchange rate. The experiment was divided into 7 blocks of 20 trials, presented in a random order. In each block, the mean exchange rate was one of the following: {0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 1, 2, 3, 4}. For example, if the exchange rate was 0.25, then four shared tokens would translate into one token for the receiver, while if the exchange rate was 4, then one shared token would translate into four tokens for the recipient.

    Figure 1. Decision screen. The subject‚Äôs decision screen was divided into a 3 by 3 grid. In each block, the subject was assigned to a new cell, highlighted in blue. Each of the other squares contained a slider showing the decision of a previous subject (a giver) for the same exchange rate. The slider showed how many tokens were given (in red) and how many tokens the recipient received (in green). This social information was collected in a previous experiment where each giver made their decisions without social information.

**Procedure**

At the beginning of the experiment, subjects first made decisions without any social information. They made 7 such decisions, one for each exchange rate, in a random order. At the end of the experiment, one random trial was selected for payment. The subject received the number of tokens they decided to keep in that trial, plus what another subject in the experiment decided to give them, plus a show-up fee.

**Eye-tracking**

There was no time constraint for these decisions. Subjects made their decisions by clicking on the slider bar, at which point they automatically advanced to the next trial. Between decision screens, subjects had to fixate on a cross at the middle of the screen. We monitored subjects‚Äô eye movements during this experiment using an SR Research EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracker.

**Learning**

Within a block, the identities of the other givers remained constant so to that the decision makers could learn about those givers‚Äô preferences. In this way, we could detect whether decision makers preferentially directed their gaze to givers with specific giving preferences. The order of the trials within a block was randomized between subjects.

**Social norm manipulation**

Each block, a new set of givers was shown. In this way, a different social norm prevailed in each block. The social information was pseudo-randomly chosen such that in some blocks a high norm was present, while in other blocks a low norm of giving was present in a way that was not highly correlated with the exchange rate. 

Subjects were recruited from the Ohio State University economics subject pool. In total 99 subjects participated in the experiment.
