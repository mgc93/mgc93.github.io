Although we controlled for possible confounding factors such as seller and item characteristics, we wanted to know if this results is robust.

In addition, higher seller experience will make rejection times less responsive to offer ratio. This might happen if sellers are aware that response times betray some private information about their preferences so they might try to manipulate their response times to some degree to signal a higher value for the item to the buyer by rejecting quickly (Figure 1).</li> <li>Sellers with less desirable items will be faster to accept offers and slower to reject offers.</li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_3_images/project_3_fig_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_3_images/project_3_fig_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_3_images/project_3_fig_2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_3_images/project_3_fig_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1.
