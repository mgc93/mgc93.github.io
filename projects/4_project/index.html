The evidence reflects the agent’s evaluation of the choice options – an agent deciding between an apple ( 🍎 ) and an orange ( 🍊 ) must weigh the benefits and costs of the apple against those of the orange.</p> <p>If these two evaluations are roughly equal ( 🍎 ~ 🍊), the agent will struggle to decide which item to choose ( 🐢 ). On the other hand, if the agent finds the orange to be much more attractive than the apple ( 🍊 &gt; 🍎 or 🍎 &gt; 🍊), then their choice will be quick and predictable ( 🐇 ). This relation between strength-of-preference and response time (RT) is a basic feature of evidence-accumulation or sequential-sampling models, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM, Figure 1).</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="300px" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>In the bargaining example, the seller must weigh the buyer’s offer against the utility of the car and/or future offers.

In that case, their RT’s might reveal their private information, putting them at a strategic disadvantage. In the bargaining example, the seller must weigh the buyer’s offer against the utility of the car and/or future offers. If the seller rejects the buyer’s offer quickly, they signal to the buyer that the offer was far too low; if the seller rejects the offer slowly, they signal to the buyer that the offer was competitive. A strategic buyer, noting the seller’s RT, should respond with a large offer increase in the former case but only a small offer increase in the latter. Therefore, a partially strategic seller would want to reject as quickly as possible, to get the largest possible offer increase from the strategic buyer. However, quick decisions come at a cost – they entail a higher chance of mistakenly rejecting a good offer or accepting a bad offer. Thus, a fully strategic seller would prepare a strategy ahead of time, allowing them to immediately respond to any offer, and keeping their information private. In that case, RT would not carry any information and would be ignored by agents in the market. Agents who have prepared strategies and who do not make mistakes are the standard in economics and game theory. Here we challenge this standard.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_8-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_8-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_8-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_8.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> **Bargaining setting.** Buyers make offers to the seller.

The voucher was worthless to the seller; their implicit goal was simply to extract the highest possible price from the buyer. The seller set an initial price from 0 to 100, which the buyer could accept or reject. If the buyer rejected the offer, the seller could try again with another price, but both the buyer’s and seller’s profits from a sale shrank by a constant factor in this case. As in real bargaining, the subjects had to weigh the costs and benefits of delaying (or preventing) a trade by either setting the price too high or rejecting an acceptable offer. There were two conditions in the experiment, with the buyer’s RT either Hidden or Visible to the seller. As with the eBay data, we focus exclusively on behavior in response to the first offer.</p> <p><strong>eBay bargaining</strong></p> <p>Our field setting is eBay – one of the world’s largest online marketplaces. Since 2005 eBay has allowed people to sell their products through an alternating-offer protocol where sellers post items for sale and buyers can make them offers. eBay recently released a dataset with millions of bargaining exchanges from June 2012 to June 2013 (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/135/3/1319/5721265?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Backus et al. 2020</a>). We analyze 20% of that data, leaving the rest for future validation. We focus on buyers’ initial offers and sellers’ responses to those offers.

We found that the drift rate in the DDM was a linear function of the buyer’s value minus the seller’s initial price (i.e., the buyer’s surplus).

While both conditions look superficially similar, a careful examination of RT reveals that buyers were significantly faster to respond in the Visible condition, particularly for rejections (b_visible = -0.32, S.E. = 0.16, p = .045 for acceptances, b_visible = -0.24, S.E. = 0.06, p = &lt;.001 for rejections).</p> <p>To compare the conditions with the DDM, we allowed non-decision time, boundary separation, starting point, and the drift-rate function to vary between conditions. We observed two noticeable differences between conditions. Buyers in the Visible condition exhibited a marginally narrower boundary separation (group posterior differences Visible - Hidden M = -0.443, HDI = [-0.92, 0.097]) and a credibly more negative drift-rate bias (group posterior differences Visible - Hidden M = -0.405, HDI = [-0.673, -0.157]).

Unlike in the lab, eBay users are not constantly monitoring their accounts and thinking about how to respond to offers. Sellers may take hours before seeing an offer and their decision process might be interrupted by sleep, work, family, etc (Fig. 5). These delays and interruptions are non-decision time. Standard DDM’s account for non-decision time with a uniform random variable.

When examining RT as a function of the offer size for more experienced sellers, we observe a speeding up of that function for acceptances, but not for rejections (b_experience = -0.144, S.E. = 0.02, p &lt; .001 for acceptances, b_experience = -0.013, S.E. = 0.03, p = 0.655 for rejections). Looking at correlations between DDM parameters and experience, we find that seller experience is negatively correlated with boundary separation (like the lab data; Spearman r(474) = -0.18, p &lt; .001) and positively correlated with drift-rate bias (opposite to the lab data; Spearman r(474) = 0.24, p &lt; .001). More experienced eBay sellers exert less response caution and evaluate offers more positively.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_17-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_17-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_17-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_17.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="400px" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 7.

Since a fast rejection from a seller should signal to the buyer that their offer was not competitive, buyers who are rejected quickly should be discouraged from coming back with a second offer. If they do make a second offer, it should be much higher than if they were rejected slowly. Indeed, in the lab experiment, Konovalov &amp; Krajbich found that second offers adjust more after a fast rejection than a slow rejection (b_rejection RT = 1.40, S.E. = 0.34, p &lt; .001). However, in the pre-existing eBay data we observed the opposite effects. Buyers were more, not less, likely to make a second offer after faster rejections (Fig. 8, b = -0.098, S.E. = 0.004, p &lt; .001) and conditional on making a second offer, those offers were lower for faster rejections (Fig. 8, b = 0.0026, S.E. = 0.0005, p &lt; .001). Thus, counter to the lab data and to our predictions, buyers on eBay appear to be encouraged by fast rejections.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_19-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_19-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_19-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_4_images/project_4_fig_19.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 8.

The inset zooms in on rejection between 0 and 2 hours.(right) Size of buyers’ compromise as a function of sellers’ rejection RT to the first offers. The buyer’s compromise is the amount that they raised their second offer, divided by the gap between the list price and buyer’s first offer.  A 100% compromise would be a second offer that is the list price; a 0% compromise would be a second offer that is the same as the first offer.

First, the nature of the deliberation in the two settings is quite similar. In the lab, the buyer must decide whether the seller’s second offer is going to be a big enough improvement to justify the cost of waiting. Similarly, on eBay the seller must decide whether some future offer is going to be a big enough improvement to justify the expected delay. The main difference between the settings is that on eBay there can be multiple buyers or multiple sellers; in the lab there was only one buyer and one seller. The presence of multiple sellers might explain why buyers are encouraged by fast rejections on eBay. If buyers are impatient and have the option to move on to other sellers, the positive signal from a slow rejection might not be enough to compensate for the buyer’s lost time. The different timescales may also play a role here – a few seconds of delay in a fixed-duration lab experiment is costless to the seller, but a few hours of delay on eBay may be excruciating. While this explanation may account for why buyers are less likely to return to a slow seller, it doesn’t explain why second offers are smaller after faster rejections. One potential explanation might be that fast sellers are perceived as being more eager to sell. A separate issue is that on eBay there are potentially multiple reasons why more experienced sellers might appear to have narrower boundaries: in addition to strategic considerations, it could also be that they deal with more offers and so check their accounts more often, are less distracted, etc. These are interesting questions for future research.</p> <h2 id="conclusions">🏁 Conclusions</h2> <hr> <p>In conclusion, we’ve demonstrated that people make strategic decisions, sometimes ones that take hours or days, in a way that is consistent with noisy evidence accumulation and comparison, i.e., sequential sampling or drift diffusion. This means that RT is an important strategic variable to be incorporated into game theory, and that the range of applications of sequential sampling models like the DDM is greater than previously thought.</p> <h2 id="-outcomes">🌟 Outcomes</h2> <hr> <p>Presented the project at various conferences:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.ic2s2.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">International Conference on Computational Social Science, 2023</a></li> <li>Psychology Graduate Research Forum at Ohio State University, 2022</li> <li><a href="https://neuroeconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SNE-Conference-2022_Program-1.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Annual Meeting for the Society of Neuroeconomics, 2022</a></li> <li><a href="https://neuroeconomics.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/SNE-Conference-2022_Program-1.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Consumer Neuroscience Satellite Symposium, 2022</a></li> <li><a href="https://sjdm.org/programs/2022-program.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Society for Judgment and Decision Making Annual Conference, 2022</a></li> <li><a href="http://w3.econlab.arizona.edu/esa2021/index.php/choice-process-data-workshop/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">North-American Economic Science Association Conference, Choice Process Tracing Workshop, 2021</a></li> </ul> <p>Working currently at a new version of the paper to submit for publishing soon.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Miruna Cotet.
