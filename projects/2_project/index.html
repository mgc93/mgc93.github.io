Examples of such behavior include overeating, overspending, not working hard enough, exercising too little, not saving enough and so on.</p> <p>Here, we used behavioral and eye-tracking experiments to study how people learn when their choices yield both immediate and delayed reward information. Subjects faced a series of binary choices between stimuli that yielded two rewards. Importantly, the rewards themselves were all delivered at the end of the study so there was no reason to weight immediate and delayed rewards differently. In some trials, the stimulus with the larger total reward had a smaller immediate reward. Overweighting immediate rewards could lead to errors in these cases.</p> <p>We modeled learning in this task using an extension of a simple Reinforcement Learning model, embedded in a dynamic choice model testing whether our subjects learned from immediate rewards at a higher rate than from delayed rewards. Using eye-tracking, we also tested whether our subjects preferentially gazed at immediate rewards compared to delayed rewards. We correlated the individual learning rate parameters to the proportion of dwell time difference spent on either type of reward to test whether attention could explain any differences in learning rates. We also investigated whether any learning biases were linked to distorted declarative memories for those stimuli. Finally, we also tested whether any learning biases were related to working memory or intertemporal preferences.</p> <h2 id="-research-question">🔍 Research question</h2> <hr> <p>Do people discount <strong>delayed reward</strong> information relative to <strong>immediate reward</strong> information, even if the timing of the information has no impact on the delivery of the reward?</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="600px" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Imagine you’re in a situation where you have to decide which action to take.

Subjects were more likely to choose a descending option than an ascending option, were more likely to make an error when the ascending option was the correct choice, and put more weight on the immediate feedback than the delayed feedback. Moreover, this bias increased over the course of the experiment.</p> <p>Looking at subjects’ choices, we found that they put more weight on immediate rewards compared to delayed rewards. For the same total reward, the option with the higher immediate reward was more likely to be chosen than its counterpart with the lower immediate reward (Fig. 4A,B).</p> <p>We confirmed these results using regressions of <em>Choose Left</em> on differences in the average immediate, delayed, and total rewards between the left and right options, as well as whether the options were ascending or descending.  We used mixed-effects regressions with random intercepts and slopes at the subject level.  For each trial we calculated the relevant average rewards seen by the subject up to that point in the experiment.  Choosing the left option was more likely when it was descending as opposed to ascending (Study 1: <em>p &lt; .001</em>; Study 2: <em>p &lt; .017</em>; Fig. 4D) or when the right option was ascending rather than descending (Study 1: <em>p &lt; .001</em>; Study 2: <em>p &lt; .001</em>; Fig. 4D), controlling for the difference in total reward.  Subjects put larger weights on immediate rewards than delayed rewards.

To do so, we employed an RL model embedded in a drift diffusion model (DDM), but allowed different learning rates for immediate and delayed rewards.</p> <p>We fitted a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model (RLDDM). This type of model combines a Reinforcement Learning model based on the Rescorla-Wagner rule for the value of each stimulus with a Drift Diffusion Model that accounts for both choices and RTs. Instead of using the logistic function to transform values into action probabilities, we use the DDM model to predict not only choices, but also response times (see project on <a href="How%20cognitive%20modeling%20can%20identify%20response%20biase%20464e9b02091a4d3285f23f11ac212e19.md">cognitive modeling in negotiation</a> for additional explanation about the DDM).</p> <p>Given that each stimulus (s) was associated with two rewards, one immediate and one delayed ($r^{I},r^{D}$ ), the total value for a stimulus was the sum of the predicted values for the immediate value and the delayed value ($V_{k}(s_{k})$). The two values generate two different prediction errors, one for the immediate reward and one for the delayed reward on each trial ($k$). The learning rate controls ($\alpha^{I}, \alpha^{D}$) how much expectations about the value of the stimuli are updated. The predicted value of a stimulus is the total of the immediate value and the delayed value. In order to determine if learning occurred at different rates for the immediate and delayed rewards, we also fitted a restricted model in which the learning rate was the same for both rewards ($\alpha^{I} = \alpha^{D} = \alpha$).</p> <p>The priors for the parameters of interest were chosen to be vague to have minimal influence on the posterior. Both learning rates and the weight of the delayed reward have beta distributed priors with shape parameters equal to one.</p> \[V^{I}_{k+1}(s_{k}) = V^{I}_{k}(s_{k}) + \alpha^{I}(r^{I}_{k} - V^{I}_{k}(s_{k})\] \[V^{D}_{k+1}(s_{k}) = V^{D}_{k}(s_{k}) + \alpha^{D}(r^{D}_{k} - V^{D}_{k}(s_{k})\] \[V_{k}(s_{k}) = V^{I}_{k}(s_{k}) + V^{D}_{k}(s_{k})\] \[v \sim d(V_{k,correct(s_{k})}-V_{k,incorrect(s_{k})})\] \[RT_{k,correct} \sim Wiener(a, t, z = 0.5, v)\] \[RT_{k,incorrect} \sim Wiener(a,t,1-z = 0.5,-v)\] <p><strong>Fitting procedure</strong></p> <p>The software Stan was used to find the best fitting parameters for each subject separately. Estimates of the posteriors for each parameter were obtained using Monte-Carlo Markov Chain sampling method. For each subject, four chains were run in parallel. To construct posterior distributions, each chain was sampled for 10,000 iterations including an initial burn-in period of 5,000 samples. The potential scale reduction factor (PSRF; Brooks &amp; Gelman, 1998) or R-hat is used to indicate chain convergence. This method compares the between and within chain estimates for model parameters. A value near smaller than 1.05 indicates convergence. To check stability of the estimates, effective sample size is used (ESS). ESS is the effective number of steps in the MCMC chain after the autocorrelation is factored out (Kruschke, 2020).</p> <p><strong>Model validation</strong></p> <p>To check whether the model mimics the data well, a posterior predictive check was conducted.

This was true for both studies (Study 1: <em>M Immediate</em> = 0<em>.</em>27<em>, M Delayed</em> = 0<em>.</em>14<em>, t</em>(86) = 6<em>.</em>97<em>,</em> 95%<em>CI</em> = [0<em>.</em>09<em>,</em>0<em>.</em>16]<em>, p &lt; .001</em>; Study 2: <em>M Immediate</em> = 0<em>.</em>23<em>, M Delayed</em> = 0<em>.</em>18<em>, t</em>(88) = 2<em>.</em>75<em>,</em> 95%<em>CI</em> = [0<em>.</em>01<em>,</em>0<em>.</em>09]<em>, p</em> = <em>.</em>007).</p> <p><strong>Model comparison</strong></p> <p>According to subject-level WAIC, the model with differential learning provides a better fit for 48% of our subjects while the model with the same learning rate for both types of rewards fit 52% of our subjects better. Thus, about half of our subjects were better described by two different learning rates.</p> <h3 id="-eye-tracking-results">👀 Eye-tracking Results</h3> <p>In Study 2 we collected eye-tracking data while subjects made their choices. We sought to test whether subjects allocated more gaze to the immediate or delayed rewards, and whether the relative fraction of dwell time on the two rewards predicted the learning bias. We observed a tendency to dwell longer on the immediate rewards compared to the delayed rewards, but this gaze bias was not correlated with the behavioral bias. On the whole, subjects tended to look more at the immediate reward compared to the delayed reward (Fig. 8). Using subject-level regressions, we found that 21 out of 75 subjects had a significant gaze bias towards the immediate reward and 14 out of 75 had a significant gaze bias towards the delayed reward.</p> <p>Surprisingly, gaze biases did not positively correlate with choice biases. This was true both when using the behavioral bias calculated from the regressions (Dwell Proportion: <em>r</em>(73) = <em>−.</em>09<em>, p</em> = <em>.</em>425; First Fixation: <em>r</em>(73) = <em>−.</em>24<em>, p</em> = <em>.</em>042) and when using the learning rates from the RL model (Dwell Proportion: <em>r</em>(73) = <em>−.</em>20<em>, p</em> = <em>.</em>086; First Fixation: <em>r</em>(73) = <em>−.</em>22<em>, p</em> = <em>.</em>064). If anything, the correlation was in the opposite direction to what we expected.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_9-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_2_images/project_2_fig_9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="70%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption text-left"> Figure 8.

In our task, subjects merely had to add together two (small) numbers to determine the total reward from their choice. And yet, subjects put between 1.4 and 2.4 times as much weight on the immediate rewards compared to the delayed rewards, roughly equivalent to counting the immediate rewards twice. This resulted in 12 to 30% increases in errors when the option with the smaller immediate reward was the wrong choice. Surprisingly, this immediacy bias only grew stronger as the experiment progressed. At the same time, we also observed an attentional bias towards immediate feedback – people spend about 53% of the time looking at the immediate feedback. However, this gaze bias does not correlate with the choice bias. We also found some suggestive evidence that this immediacy bias may be linked to impatience and working-memory deficits.</p> <p>In summary, we’ve shown that people show a bias to learn more from immediate feedback than even slightly delayed feedback. This has major implications for how we evaluate people’s choices. As opposed to ascribing impatient behavior to an unwillingness to wait, we argue that impatience may be due to delayed rewards appearing smaller than they actually are, perhaps due to inattention to delayed feedback. This may explain why impatience and temporal inconsistency are such pervasive problems.</p> <h2 id="-outcomes">🌟 Outcomes</h2> <hr> <p>Won a $2,250 grant for the project: Decision Sciences Collaborative Research Grant at the Ohio State University, 2020.</p> <p>Presented the project at the <a href="https://www.fox.temple.edu/faculty-research/institutes-centers/center-applied-research-decision-making/interdisciplinary-symposium-decision-neuroscience-2023" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Interdisciplinary Symposium in Decision Neuroscience, 2023</a>.</p> <p>Presented a poster of the project at EADM Summer School on Learning and Decision Making, 2022.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Miruna Cotet.
