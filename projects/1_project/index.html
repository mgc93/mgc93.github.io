The dataset consists of millions of bargaining exchanges.</p> <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Each bargaining exchange contains:</p> <ul> <li>identification variables for seller, buyer and item</li> <li>seller experience variables such as number of previous bargaining exchanges they have participated in or number of listings created</li> <li>item characteristics variables such as list price, category name, number of views, listing age</li> <li>offer characteristics variables such as <ul> <li>offer price,</li> <li>response to the offer (acceptance, rejection, counteroffer, expired, automatically accepted, automatically rejected, rejected because another buyer‚Äôs offer was accepted)</li> <li>response time (time between when the offer was made and when the seller responded).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Data partition:</strong> In order to preserve some of the data for later replication analyses, the dataset was randomly partitioned into five parts, each with approximately 20% of the dataset. The partition was done randomly at the seller level to ensure that all exchanges including a specific seller were in only one part. For the analyses in this project, I only use one randomly selected part (i.e. 20%) of the data.</p> <p><strong>Data cleaning:</strong> I wanted to make sure I exclude any errors in the dataset and also restrict the analyses to the relevant cases.</p> <p>I cleaned the data by first excluding exchanges with errors such as (1) If the item is sold, the sale price is above the listing price (0.2% excluded); (2) An offer is above the list price (1.8% excluded) and so on.</p> <p>I also exclude other cases that might interfere with the question of interest such as (1) The seller has an accept or reject price threshold set (36% excluded); (2) No competing offers arriving at the same time the seller is considering another offer (8.6% excluded); (3) No messages included with the offer (9.8% excluded).</p> <p>The final dataset of first buyer‚Äôs offers after applying all the restrictions consisted of 1,128,999 bargaining exchanges spread across 1,043,320 listings with 74,443 sellers and 743,343 buyers.</p> <p><strong>Analysis 1</strong> (modeling non-monotonicity in the data using <strong>Generalized Additive Models</strong>): Because I noticed that the response time to offers wasn‚Äôt monotonic, I decided to use Generalized Additive Models to visualize and test for the effect of offer price as a percent of list price on the response time of the seller. These models incorporate smooth functions of the independent variables (<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Generalized_Additive_Models.html?id=HL-PDwAAQBAJ" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wood et al. 2017</a>). These models are also useful to identify ranges in which the data is monotonic. The GAM regressions identify [0.36, 0.68] as the range of offers for which both acceptance and rejection response times were monotonic. This was done based on when the first derivative of each GAM became significantly different from zero beyond their peaks (calculated using finite differences).</p> <p><strong>Analysis 2</strong> (modeling item category and seller level effects using <strong>linear mixed effects regressions</strong>): Using the restricted offer range in which the relationship between offer and response time was linear, I look at whether the effect is present for each item category and for each seller, not just in the aggregate.

Then, I look at whether the same relationship between offer and RT of the seller holds in cases where the threshold was privately set but the offer was either above the reject threshold or below the accept thresholds. In these cases, I can use the threshold as a boundary for the seller‚Äôs true valuation of the item.</p> <p>The pre-existing data from eBay indicate that most sellers (62%) do not use automatic thresholds. In the subset of data that I analyzed, 17% used only rejection thresholds, 5.4% used only acceptance thresholds, and 15.7% used both thresholds. To examine the effect of seller experience on automatic threshold use, I looked at the number of best-offer listings created by each seller (dating back to 2008), The relation between seller experience and threshold usage was quadratic ‚Äì both inexperienced and highly experienced sellers used thresholds more than medium-experience sellers (Fig. 6A). While these results do not rule out that sellers have plans, the low rate of automatic thresholds suggests that sellers prefer to evaluate offers as they arrive. Moreover, for the exchanges with thresholds, a similar pattern between offer and RT holds (Fig. 6B).</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_9-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_9-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_9-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_9.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="450px" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_10-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_10-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_10-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="400px" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 6.

Since a fast rejection from a seller should signal to the buyer that their offer was not competitive, buyers who are rejected quickly should be discouraged from coming back with a second offer. Instead, I observed the opposite effects. Does this happen on eBay?</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong> Indeed, in a lab experiment from my lab, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/uead055" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Konovalov &amp; Krajbich (2023)</a> found that second offers adjust more after a fast rejection than a slow rejection. However, in the existing eBay data, I observed the opposite effects. Buyers were more, not less, likely to make a second offer for faster rejections (Fig. 8A) and conditional on making a second offer, those offers were lower for faster rejections (Fig. 8B). Thus, counter to the lab data and to our predictions, buyers on eBay appear to be encouraged by a fast rejection.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_13-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_13-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_13-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_13.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_14-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_14-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_14-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project_1_images/project_1_fig_14.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 8. Buyers react adversely to slow sellers. A. Buyers‚Äô median RT (in hours) as a function of sellers‚Äô compromise, conditional on the buyer accepting or rejecting the offers. The seller‚Äôs compromise is the amount that they lowered their counteroffer, divided by the gap between the list price and the buyer‚Äôs offer. A 100% compromise would be a counteroffer that matches the buyer‚Äôs offer; a 0% compromise would be a counteroffer that is the list price. B. Size of buyers‚Äô compromise as a function of sellers‚Äô rejection RT to the first offers. The size of the dots indicates the relative amount of data in that bin and the bars represent bootstrapped standard errors across buyers. </div> <p>In order to investigate whether there was selection bias when analyzing buyers‚Äô second offers, I first looked at the probability of the buyer making a second offer as a function of the first offer. Buyers were most likely to make a second offer if their first offer was around half of the list price. For other first offers there was a sharp decrease in the likelihood of making a second offer. To account for this selection bias, I used the Heckman correction (<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/1912352" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Heckman, 1979</a>).</p> <p>The Heckman correction is a two-step statistical approach that corrects for non-randomly selected samples. In the first stage, I modeled the probability of the buyer making a second offer conditional on the first offer being rejected. This model helps identify the factors that influence whether the buyer makes a second offer or the selection process and calculates the inverse Mills ratio. The inverse Mills ratio is a measure of the probability of an observation being included in the sample, given its characteristics and the estimated parameters from the selection equation. It provides a way to quantify the selection bias that arises when the sample is not randomly selected from the population. In the second stage, I correct for self-selection by incorporating the inverse Mills ratio as an additional explanatory variable. This adjusted regression accounts for the selection bias by incorporating the correction factor from the selection equation. I estimated this model using the R package sampleSelection. The results do not change when accounting for this sampling bias.</p> <h2 id="conclusions">üèÅ¬†Conclusions</h2> <hr> <p>These results show, using data from eBay‚Äôs bargaining exchanges, that a significant proportion of responders do not adhere to preset strategies but decide in real-time in a way that reveals private information. The time agents take to respond becomes an inadvertent indicator of their evaluation of an offer. These findings show that RT can unintentionally expose an person‚Äôs private preferences, offering a potential strategic advantage to the proposers.</p> <h2 id="-outcomes">üåü Outcomes</h2> <hr> <p>This is an updated version of a preprint I posted online in 2020.
