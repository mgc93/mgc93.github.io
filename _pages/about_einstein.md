Behavioral Scientist pursuing a PhD in Decision Psychology at Ohio State University, specializing in understanding the relationship between attention, response times, and decision-making. My research revolves around how individuals are influenced by social information and how they strategically behave in social interactions. I analyze behavioral data using computational models to uncover cognitive processes and biases that underlie human decision-making.

My passion lies in using behavioral insights to help people make better decisions.
