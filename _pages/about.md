Behavioral Scientist pursuing a PhD in **Decision Psychology** at Ohio State University, specializing in understanding the relationship between attention, response times, and decision-making. 

My interest is in how individuals are influenced by social information and how they behave strategically in social interactions. I analyze behavioral data using computational models to uncover cognitive processes and biases that underlie human decision-making.

My goal is to use behavioral insights to help people make better decisions.
